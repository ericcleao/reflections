What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It's created a directory called .git to save all my history of commits. I need do that to have this history and use the git at my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a place where a tacked my files before I commit them, its help me to look what files I will commit, depends what's the logic behind them, and thats help to me to don't worry about start another idea before commit the last one.
