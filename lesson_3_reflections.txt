When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work with a team or when I will work from several differents computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it can be confusing, other person can make changes at the project and if the git made a automatic pull I probably would be lost about what is new.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Branches: Use when I do any change important at my code
    - Clones: Use when I need to get what is at remote repository that I'm working
    - Forks: Use when I need(and can) use the other person's project and will start a new project based at this project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can work with all the update made by others collaborators, if they send it to the remote repository and I won't sync it, for example, I can be doing something that other person already made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Easier: I won't need to learn anything new, I can just send my project's actual state and wait for the feedback.
	Harder: I couldn't work simultaneously with other person because it will cause conflicts and it would not be easy to correct

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
